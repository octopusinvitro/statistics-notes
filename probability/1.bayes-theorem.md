# Probability


## Dependency

The flip of a coin does not affect the next. These events are independent.  
Grabbing a card from a deck affects the next. These events are dependent.  
If we put the card in the deck, it does not affect the next. These will be independent.

In other words, dependency comes from taking outcomes out of the universe.


## Operations

### Addition Rule

* If non mutually exclusive:  
P(A U  B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B), also:  
P(A || B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A && B)

* If mutually exclusive, the intersection is empty:  
P(A U  B) = P(A) + P(B)


### Conditional Probability

Measures the probability of one event occurring, given that another one has already occurred, when the events are dependent. If the events are independent, the probability is the same.

Probability of A given B = P(A∣B)

* Dependent: P(A∣B) = X
* Independent: P(A∣B) = P(A)​


### Multiplication Rule

To calculate the probability that two events happen **simultaneously**.

* Dependent: P(A && B) or P(A ∩ B) = **P(A)⋅P(B∣A)**
* Independent: P(A && B) or P(A ∩ B) = **P(A)⋅P(B)**


## Bayes theorem

Given a result, what is the probability that you have reached it through a specific branch.

```plaintext
        P(B|A) <--- branch ---
      /                       |
P(A)                          |
      \                       | --- P(B) = P(B|A) + P(B|A!)
        P(C|A)                |
                              |
        P(B|!A) <-------------  
      /
P(!A)
      \
        P(C|!A)

```

It's the probability of the branch divided by the total probability of the result.

**P(A|B) = P(A)⋅P(B|A) / P(B)**
